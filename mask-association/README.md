# Mask association
We thank authors of `Efficient 3D Instance Mapping and Localization with Neural Fields` for sharing their code for refence.

## Installation

Assume sdfstudio is installed already with `LabelMaker/env_v2/install_sdfstudio_env.sh`

```bash install_mask_association_env.sh```

## Example
Use ```prepare_data.py``` to transform data into deeplate format, assuming the semantic/instance masks are available already.

See ```mask_association_test.ipynb``` for example usage of mask-association.
