# Mask association
We thank authors of Efficient 3D Instance Mapping and Localization with Neural Fields for sharing their code for refence.

## Installation

```bash install_mask_association_env.sh```

## Example
Use ```prepare_data.py``` to transform data into deeplate format, assuming the semantic/instance masks are available already.

See ```mask_association_test.ipynb``` for example usage of mask-association.
