# Mask association
We thank authors of `Efficient 3D Instance Mapping and Localization with Neural Fields` for sharing their code for refence.

## Installation

Assuming sdfstudio is installed already with `LabelMaker/env_v2/install_sdfstudio_env.sh`

```bash install_mask_association_env.sh```

## Example
Use ```prepare_data.py``` to transform data into deeplate format, assuming the instance masks are available already, or use  `LabelMaker/models/grounded_sam_instance.py` to generate instance masks. 

See ```mask_association_test.ipynb``` for example usage of mask-association.
